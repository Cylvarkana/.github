## 💎 About
The Cylvarkana ecosystem advances cyber threat intelligence tooling through modular, scalable solutions across a wide variety of disciplines. Like mycorrhizal networks in nature, we harness the interconnectedness of information to reveal hidden insights and enhance security practices. Our name comes from the latin roots *silva* for 🌲forest (with a **cy**ber twist) and *arcana* for 🔑secrets.

We are dedicated to supporting the open-source community by creating tools that are accessible, collaborative, and designed to empower users. Through shared knowledge and collective innovation, we aim to foster a culture of transparency and cooperation in cybersecurity.
